Developed an interactive Java-based dashboard to analyze and explore song datasets, demonstrating skills in data processing, GUI design, and software engineering. Key features include:
Data Analysis:
Processed a large TSV dataset of songs, extracting key insights such as unique artists, average song properties, and popular metrics.
Implemented query-based filtering with logical operators (e.g., AND, >, <=) to extract song subsets based on customizable criteria.
Interactive GUI:
Designed a Java Swing-based interface to filter songs by artist, album, and properties.
Created a custom hybrid chart combining a circular bar chart and radar chart using Java2D, visualizing song properties like tempo, loudness, and valence.
Advanced Features:
Real-time data updates based on user interactions with dynamic filters.
Exception handling to validate dataset integrity and gracefully manage errors.
Technical Stack:
Leveraged Java Collections Framework for efficient data manipulation.
Extended and customized abstract classes to implement reusable, modular code.
Ensured code quality through JUnit testing and adherence to best practices.
